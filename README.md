## API

### Config.lua

Config.lua contains configuration parameters (documented in the file itself) and slides definitions.

Slides can be defined with the defineSlide function.

#### defineSlide(table) 
Adds a new slide to the slideshow. Can take these params in the table:

* text : The text of the slide. Gets passed to the slide script as _TEXT.
* font : An alternative font for the slide. Gets passed to the slide script as _FONT.
* fontsize : An alternative font size for the slide. Gets passed to the slide script as _FONTSIZE.
* notes: Notes to appear on the second screen
* duration : Expected duration of the slide
* script : The lua script implementing the slide. If nil, DefaultSlide.lua is used.
* options : A table which gets passed to the slide script.
 
### Slides scripts

Slides are implemented in Lua scripts.

Slides can implement three methods:

* draw(time) : *mandatory* - Gets called every frame to draw the slide. time is in seconds, from the slide start.
* reset() : Called if the slide must be reset for any reason, or at the start of the slide itself.
* click() : Called when the user left-clicks.

The following functions are supported in slides.

#### next()

Goes to the next slide. 

#### prev()

Goes to the prev slide. 

#### text(text [,face [,fontsize]])

Creates a centered text sprite, with the given text, font face and size. Only text is mandatory. See "sprite" to see how to operate on sprites.

#### sprite(filename)

Creates a sprite reading the specified image file.

A sprites supports these functions:

* draw(x [,y [,opacity]]) : draws the sprite at (x,y) (0,0 by default) with the specified opacity (1.0 by default).
* blit(sx, sy, w, h, dx, dy [,opacity]) : draws at dx,dy a portion of the sprite which goes from sx,sy of the given width and height
* stretch(x, y, w, h, [,opacity]) : stretches the sprite to fill the rectangle at (x,y) of the given width and height

#### shader(filename)

Loads the specified precompiled HLSL shader.

A shader supports these functions:

* on() : activates the shader
* off() : deactivates the shader, restoring fixed pipeline functionality
* set(name, value) : sets a uniform named "name" to a float of the specified value
